# merlin816
The purpose of this project is to reproduce the assembling capabilities of the Merlin 8/16 Macroassembler as published in 1987 by Roger Wagner Publishing Inc., and as detailed here: http://www.apple-iigs.info/doc/fichiers/merlin816.pdf

My intention is to be able to compile source codes written for the Merlin 8/16 Macroassembler, to be then run by a 6502 emulator. I therefore do not intend to reproduce any user interface, as in the original assembler, but just a command-line tool.

The code is written in Python. 

This project is still WIP.
